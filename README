Regexp-Log-Common
=================

Regexp::Log::Common enables simple parsing of log files created using the
Common Log Format or the Extended Common Log Format, such as the logs generated
by the httpd web server using the keyword 'common'.

Regexp::Log::Common uses Regexp::Log as a base class, to generate regular
expressions for performing the usual data munging tasks on log files that
cannot be simply split().

For more information on how to use this module, please see Regexp::Log.

LOG FORMATS

The Common Log Format is made up of several fields to record requests and
responses by a webserver. There are two traditional layouts, refered to as the
common and extended layouts. However, you may wish to create a log format of
your own, using the field specifiers as defined by the Common Log Format
Specification [1]. 

With this module you may define your log format as common or extended, for
example:

    my $foo = Regexp::Log::Common->new( format  => ':common' );

or you can define your own format, such as:

    my $foo = Regexp::Log::Common->new(
        format  => '%host %rfc %authuser %date %request %status %bytes' .
                   '%referer %useragent %time %servername',
        capture => [qw( host rfc authuser ts request status bytes
                        referer useragent time servername)],
    );
