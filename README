Regexp::Log::Common
-------------------

Regexp::Log::Common enables simple parsing of log files created using the
Common Log Format or the Extended Common Log Format, such as the logs generated
by the httpd web server using the keyword 'common'.

Regexp::Log::Common uses Regexp::Log as a base class, to generate regular
expressions for performing the usual data munging tasks on log files that
cannot be simply split().

For more information on how to use this module, please see Regexp::Log.
